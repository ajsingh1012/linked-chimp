##### For so long, primates have led better lives than us humans. But now, this must change...

# Introducing: LinkedChimp
### The only known website that tries to solve this problem.

This website features sign-in, profile editing, profile sharing, and messaging functionalities. The goal of this website was to make something intellectually interesting, with a smooth and intuitive interface.

Perhaps, for clarity, I should state that this project is satirical; I do not hold the ideology of anarcho-primitivism, and the tone is intentionally extreme. The main principle is that the website _emulates_ the 'limiting' of free speech and 'encouragement' of extreme thought, i.e.: it says that one is only allowed to speak in the chat room if and only if their message is 'ideologically correct,' creating an echochamber; the profile editor page allows selection from only a few profile pictures; and, every profile shows a user's statement as an 'ideological imperative.'
